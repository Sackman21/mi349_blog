        The Last of Us
    </h2>
    <p> 
        The Last of Us is a video game that holds a special place in my heart. 
        The games takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a zombie outbreak caused by a fungal infection. 
        Throughout the game you play as a man named Joel Miller and he is tasked with protecting and taking a girl
        named Ellie across the country as she seems to be immune from the infection and she could be used to make a cure.
