        The Last of Us
    </h2>
    <p> 
        The Last of Us is a video game that holds a special place in my heart. 
        The games takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a zombie outbreak caused by a fungal infection. 
        Throughout the game you play as a man named Joel Miller and he is tasked with protecting and taking a girl
        named Ellie across the country as she seems to be immune from the infection and she could be used to make a cure.
        The reason I like this game is because I feel like it does a great job at telling its story and I can feel connected
        the characters. I really love this game and I was slightly disappointed with the sequal but I still enjoyed it.
        I wish I could go back in time to play it for the first time again. As well as being one of my favorite games,
        it was the beggining of my love of horror. I know will read, watch, and play anything horror related.
        I got this game when it came out in 2013 and I would play it all the time. I almost beat it on every
        difficulty the game had including new game+ on each difficulty.
