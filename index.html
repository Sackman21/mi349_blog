            The Last of Us

            The Last of Us is a video game that holds a special place in my heart. 
            The games takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a zombie outbreak caused by a fungal infection. 
            Throughout the game you play as a man named Joel Miller and he is tasked with protecting and taking a girl
            named Ellie across the country as she seems to be immune from the infection and she could be used to make a cure.
            The reason I like this game is because I feel like it does a great job at telling its story and I can feel connected
            the characters. I really love this game and I was slightly disappointed with the sequel but I still enjoyed it.
            I wish I could go back in time to play it for the first time again. As well as being one of my favorite games,
            it was the beginning of my love of horror. I know will read, watch, and play anything horror related.
            I got this game when it came out in 2013 and I would play it all the time. I almost beat it on every
            difficulty the game had including new game plus on each difficulty.

        <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>

        <p class="Blog-Post2">
            Dungeons and Dragons is a table-top role-playing game where you can be in a fantasy world and everything
            is up to your imagination. I will be talking about one of my characters I made. Meet Coldroth. 
            Coldroth is a Dragoborn Monk, who's goal is to locate this mysterious black cubes that have been found in various
            locations around the world. He fights by punching and using his inner focus to stun enemies from doing anything for
            small amount of time. During his adventures, he got infected with some unknown parasite. He can feel it moving
            around inside of him and sometimes it makes him sprout tentacles and other body horror things. Recently, he found out 
            that is home is under attack by something and wants to go back as soon as he can. He knows one of his allies will help him
            if he helps them first. So he is putting off his goal for the mean time to gain the power of an ally that he is 
            going to desperately need. He is a terrible liar and feels guilty for causing the attack in his people by telling the 
            over lording country the horrible things that he and his group has done. He does not know if he truly caused this attack,
            but he feels at fault nonetheless. (In the picture, Coldroth is on the far left)
